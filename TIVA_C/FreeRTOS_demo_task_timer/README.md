This is an example multitasking program that uses the FreeRTOS on the TIVA Connected LaunchPad. The program creates two tasks that blink the LED0 and LED1 at the rate of 2Hz and 4Hz respectively.

The timing is done by using a FreeRTOS software timer.

This program runs on the TIVA Connected LaunchPad that requires TIVAWARE (including the driverlib), FreeRTOS v10.0.
