This is a example program that makes use of the TivaWare software (which includes the driverlib) to configure for the GPIO and UART modules of the TIVA Connected LaunchPad. The program blinks the LED0 at the rate of 2Hz and increments a blinking count, which is sent out through the UART.

This program runs on the TIVA Connected LaunchPad that requires TIVAWARE (including the driverlib), FreeRTOS v10.0.
